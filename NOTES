This is to document nonintuitive things about making textures, in hopes of helping others who are interested in making textures.

## Versions
It helps to put the version number in the description for a texture pack. My "newversion" script handles this and bumps the UUID too. The Minecraft UI does not have a good display for versions (for now), so do your users a favour and make it visible.

## Transparency
I have heard (but not verified) that it is only valid to use transparency with certain blocks; this makes sense as otherwise people would modify most blocks to be transparent for PVP, and also because Minecraft does certain optimisations with regards to what blocks exist that have not been exposed yet; allowing all blocks to be transparent would ruin such optimisations.

## Emissivity
Don't go overboard with emissivity in MER. The upper bounds of the value scale are ridiculously bright.

## Grass
I believe the reason that grass does not have a colour in its textures is that it displays differently in some biomes, so the textures are leaving room for an interaction between the renderer and biome id to finish the colouration.

## Torches
I haven't figured this one out yet, although I get that a lit torch is a mix of a block texture for the basic shape and a particle effect and those must line up for things to work right. There may be a fixed geometry that torches must have around which the texture must fit.

## Glazed Terracotta
Most glazed terracottas are designed to have fold rather than wrap symmetry in the default texture pack; a few have both. The nVidia texture packs have blank textures for a lot of these (making good textures for these is high-effort and it's not surprising they skipped out and focused on other things.
