## Diamond Sword

Found a photo called "Cold Steel 88S 1796 Cavalry Saber" on Google Images. Tried, inexpertly, to draw it. Decided that the entire blade would not be diamond; rather there would be a transition from steel to diamond as one moves to the edge of the blade. Used a gradient effect for that. Current effort is very much a first draft.

## Netherite Sword

Based off the Diamond Sword texture, but uses hue replacement to swap the cyan for a purple. Wanted to keep close to the diamond sword texture because it's supposed to be crafted from diamond swords.
