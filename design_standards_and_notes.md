# Stone and stone-based ores
## Stone
![Stone](dlight/textures/blocks/stone.png?raw=true)

Should give a feel of a variety of stones weathered together, with some cracks going through. This is the basis for most overworld ores; overworld ores are based on a copy of this texture, modified to add their distinctive substance. Consequently, redoing stone would require changing a lot of other textures.

## Coal Ore
![Coal Ore](dlight/textures/blocks/coal_ore.png?raw=true)

Coal adds some very dark dusty coal to stone, largely in areas that are already cracked. This is primarily round, in varying sizes, shapes, and orientations.

## Diamond Ore
![Diamond Ore](dlight/textures/blocks/diamond_ore.png?raw=true)

Adds 4 diamond protrusions 3 and 4 sided, at various orientations) to the stone, with dark black outlines (representing a crust, and increasing visual difference from stone). The interiour of the protrusions have patterns of lighter and darker light trying to give a 3d look (this doesn't work very well), and there's a pale blue glow on the outside of the patterns.

## Emerald Ore
![Emerald Ore](dlight/textures/blocks/emerald_ore.png?raw=true)

Adds 6 green protrusions of primarily round shapes at varying sizes to stone. These are generally a darker green crust surrounding a brighter green interiour. The upper-left is a series of very small pieces. The upper-right has a long tail like a japanese ghost.

## Gold Ore
![Gold Ore](dlight/textures/blocks/gold_ore.png?raw=true)

Adds various gold protrusions to stone, of various sizes and in most locations, avoiding the brown sections of the stone texture and focusing slightly on areas that "look weak". The gold is distinguished from yellow through near-white touching up of the overall yellow colour.

## Iron Ore
![Iron Ore](dlight/textures/blocks/iron_ore.png?raw=true)

Adds three very large protrusions to stone, in a shape vaguely like the japanese "ni" hiragana. The shapes have a very dark outline, with the inside being a mix of rust, pale blue, and white. The colours are designed to suggest some oxidation and some shininess, and the decision to avoid orange is to reserve that colour for copper.

## Lapis Lazuli Ore
![Lapis Lazuli Ore](dlight/textures/blocks/lapis_ore.png?raw=true)

Adds many smaller, primarily round protrusions to stone, all of the colour of real lapis lazuli. There are also some cracks of that colour as well as "mist" coming from all lapis intrusions into the stone. Glows.

## Redstone Ore
![Redstone Ore](dlight/textures/blocks/redstone_ore.png?raw=true)

Adds many red protrusions to stone, the larger diamond shapes. Some lines in these shapes have magenta tones. Also adds light pink fog to some other parts of the stone texture. Glows.

# Other Stones and their polished variant
## Andesite
![Andesite](dlight/textures/blocks/stone_andesite.png?raw=true)

Varying shades of dark grey. Like a foggy night with luna and some stars visible.

## Andesite Polished
![Andesite Polished](dlight/textures/blocks/stone_andesite_smooth.png?raw=true)

Based on andesite, but with a slightly reduced range of shades, and with a border composed of 3 shades of light grey in straight lines.

## Diorite
![Diorite](dlight/textures/blocks/stone_diorite.png?raw=true)

Varying shades of light grey with some areas of mild/pale blue overtones and a variety of crack patterns over the surface. These lightly resemble constellations. Colours look cloudy.

## Diorite Polished
![Diorite Polished](dlight/textures/blocks/stone_diorite_smooth.png?raw=true)

Based on diorite, but with a reduced range of colours, and with a border composed of 3 shades of light grey in straight lines.

## Granite
![Granite](dlight/textures/blocks/stone_granite.png?raw=true)

Cloudy muddy orange with light and dark looks, with some dark grey cracks and specks of yellow and other colours.

## Granite Polished
![Granite Polished](dlight/textures/blocks/stone_granite_smooth.png?raw=true)

Based on granite, but with a reduced range of colours, and with a border composed of three shades of orange-grey in straight lines.

# Gravel
![Gravel](dlight/textures/blocks/gravel.png?raw=true)

Entirely greyscale, resembling a zoomed-out nebula. Like a duststorm of light-grey with darker clouds, with some very dark speckles. Designed to look like dust, and like it would definitely fall down/apart if unsupported.

# Cobblestone
![Cobblestone](dlight/textures/blocks/cobblestone.png?raw=true)

Dark grey mostly round stone at various orientations. Mostly small variations in stone shades. All the stones are embedded in a mud that ranges from green to brown. The stones are dense enough that the gaps are reasonably small.

# Obsidian and Crying Obsidian
## Obsidian
![Obsidian](dlight/textures/blocks/obsidian.png?raw=true)

A very dark glassy texture, with small rough protrusions and dents, also black (rendered in a slightly darker shade). A slight white fog sits over the whole texture, to give us room to have shades of black.

## Crying Obsidian
![Crying Obsidian](dlight/textures/blocks/crying_obsidian.png?raw=true)

Based on the obsidian texture, with pink-purple light coming out of the existing dents as well as some new smaller cracks in that colour. Looks vaguely (and accidentally) like Japanese calligraphy. If we ever redo that texture, we may play this up.

# Glasses
## Plain Glass (full pane)
![Glass](dlight/textures/blocks/glass_mer.png?raw=true)
(the glass texture is a TGA file and browsers cannot render that, so this is the PBR image instead. Ignore the colours)

Entirely transparent apart from the edges, which have 3 shades of grey on the boundaries representing the frame. Has 2 layers of small stylings in each corner that echo the corner with glass between, followed by a dot. In the upper-left styling there is a mistake (that turned out well) of a dot to the right of and between the stylings. This was going to be another suspended line echoing the top border; that idea was scrapped but the first dot was accidentally left in. The irregularity looks cool so it will not be touched out, and if this is ever redesigned it may be left in.

## Other full panes of glass
Will likely be built from plain glass and just slightly tinted. Likely by a software script. This is not yet implemented.

# Sands
## Standard Sand
![Sand](dlight/textures/blocks/sand.png?raw=true)

Cloudy yellow-brown based on real photographs of sand. Darker portions look a bit wet. Has dark speckles in it. Designed, like gravel, to look like it'd definitely fall down/apart if unsupported.

## Red Sand
![Red Sand](dlight/textures/blocks/red_sand.png?raw=true)

Based on standard sand, with a hue shift towards red.

# Soul Surfaces 
## Soul Sand
![Soul Sand](dlight/textures/blocks/soul_sand.png?raw=true)

Deep red background with brighter faces at varying orientations embedded. Darker swirls around and between those faces. A small number of brown highlights. The face features themselves should emit a small amount of light.

## Soul Soil
![Soul Soil](dlight/textures/blocks/soul_soil.png?raw=true)

Based off soul sand, with the faces removed and replaced by flatter, cracked areas. Red hue is significantly diminished. As face features are gone, so is the light emission.

# Glazed Terracottas
## White Glazed Terracotta
![White Glazed Terracotta](dlight/textures/blocks/glazed_terracotta_white.png?raw=true)

Based on the standard texture very strongly for the blue portions (but higher res and more curve-y), less so for the orange sections which take somewhat different shapes and in some places have orange overtones. Hard to describe further because of the complexity of the design. Maintains the diagonal symmetry of the original.

## Green Glazed Terracotta
![Green Glazed Terracotta](dlight/textures/blocks/glazed_terracotta_green.png?raw=true)

Based loosely on the original texture; many embellishments and differences. Maintains both the edge and diagonal symmetry of the original.

## Orange Glazed Terracotta
![Orange Glazed Terracotta](dlight/textures/blocks/glazed_terracotta_orange.png?raw=true)

Based loosely on the original texture; many embellishments and differences. Maintains symmetries of the original.

# Bricks
## Standard brick
![Brick](dlight/textures/blocks/brick.png?raw=true)

Should look and feel like real bricks, perhaps slightly irregular. I don't use this block myself (I rarely encounter much clay in the game), but this should be a template for the other kinds of bricks.

## Nether brick
![Nether Brick](dlight/textures/blocks/nether_brick.png?raw=true)

Deeper red version of standard brick. Only the "brick" portions of that texture, rather than the glue between, is different.

# Netherrack and netherrack-based ores
## Netherrack
![Netherrack](dlight/textures/blocks/netherrack.png?raw=true)

Looks like a topo map, with cracked soft red and red-purple colours in the different layers. Might look like different layers of skin, or even resemble zoomed-in fingerprints. Current version of the texture does not line up very well with itself.

## Netherrack Gold Ore
![Netherrack Gold Ore](dlight/textures/blocks/nether_gold_ore.png?raw=true)

Variant of netherrack with protrusions of diamond shapes containing gold (yellow and white, like stone gold ore). The gold does not look very golden next to the netherrack and currently this block also has strange colour differences from standard netherrack that mean it doesn't fit well into a netherrack wall. Needs some fine-tuning.

## Netherrack Quartz Ore
![Netherrack Quartz Ore](dlight/textures/blocks/quartz_ore.png?raw=true)

Variant of netherrack with pale purple protrusions of mostly rounded shapes placed reasonably randomly in the block. These glow and look largely all right. Might have been better off making them white rather than pale purple; may yet make that revision.


# Misc
## Bedrock
![Bedrock](dlight/textures/blocks/bedrock.png?raw=true)

Bedrock should have a mix of a feel of out-of-bounds and a spider electrical-mineral.

## Glowstone
![Glowstone](dlight/textures/blocks/glowstone.png?raw=true)

Primarily yellow with 4 sine waves going across, each "leaning" forward or backwards. Some colour variations to keep things interesting.

## Slime
![Slime](dlight/textures/blocks/slime_mer.png?raw=true)
(the slime texture is a TGA, which lacks browser support. This is instead the MER, so ignore the colour)

Light green with blotches. Darker green square in the middle. Mostly smooth with some cracks in the mer.

## Web
![Web](dlight/textures/blocks/web_mer.png?raw=true)
(the web texture is a TGA file and browsers cannot render that, so this is the PBR image instead. Ignore the colours)

A fairly random/realistic looking spider web. Not particularly symmetric like the standard texture.
