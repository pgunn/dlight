DLight is a texture pack for Minecraft Bedrock.
I'm intending it to eventually be PBR-enabled and to do a little bit of promotion,
but for now I'm:
A) Still learning how to do this efficiently and at all, and
B) Just trying to scratch my biggest itches with existing texture packs and textures

I'm a Linux user, and primarily intend to work on this on my workstation using GIMP
and Python.

Python will be used for:
* Bumping the version string (DONE)
* Refreshing the UUID (DONE)
* Verifying that all textures mentioned in the json are present
* And that all texture files are in the correct format, size, and so on

==Making it installable==
Remember that a .mcpack file, which minecraft will install when you double click on it, is
just a zipfile with the manifest.json in the toplevel. So to make this thing installable,
make your zipfile that way and just double-clock on it.

==On Java==
I have never had an install of Minecraft Java so I have no idea if this will work on that platform.
